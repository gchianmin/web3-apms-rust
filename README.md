# ConfMan Web 3.0: A Decentralized Academic Conference Management System

This academic conference management system is a web3 dApp that aims to simplify cross border payments with less service charges. It also provides rewards and consolidated track records to conference contributors such as organising committees and reviewers of the papers. Instead of fiat currency, the system utilises cryptocurrency to perform transactions. 

A conference organiser can use the system to:
- Create a conference
- Assign reviewers to papers submitted
- Pay out to the reviewers according to the number of papers reviewed

A researcher can use the system to:
- Submit a research paper to a conference
- View the feedback given by the reviewers
- Register and make payment for the conference

A reviewer/paper chair can use the system to:
- Review the papers assigned
- Receive payout directly to the wallet
